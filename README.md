# StarFire
A remake of the classic game known as space invaders using Pygame. You have forever looked up in the night sky seeing sparkly balls of light assuming they're the shining stars across the universe. Fast forward twenty years and you've been chosen as the pilot of the spaceship set to explore outer space and set a new milestone for humankind. Once your spaceship reaches space, you quickly realize that the stars are not always the stars that we assumed but are aliens! Set at the bottom middle of your screen, you maneuver your spaceship by using the arrow keys of your keyboard and use your space bar to shoot the hostile aliens but be careful, there are friendly aliens who are just trying to help as well! Fleets of aliens will fill the sky ahead of you which you must shoot down firing bullets with the space bar however you must do so without being hit yourself. The latest tech allows you to replace your ship a limited number of times using complex quantam entaglement. If you lose all your ships, the world as we know it ends and it is game over.
